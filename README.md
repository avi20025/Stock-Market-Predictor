# RNN - Final Project

This project demonstrates RNN back propagation algorithm from scratch

### Dataset Used
https://datahub.io/core/finance-vix#resource-vix-daily 

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas (pip install ...)
- Jupyter lab and jupyter Notebook installed (or colab google) or python file

### Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or use google colab
2. Navigate to the project directory.


# Getting jupyter notebook (if working with jupyter): 
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) To install Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal (command prompt).
2. Run the following command to install Jupyter Notebook: pip install notebook

### Running the program
1. Open a Python environment and make sure you are in the correct environment (i.e. base) - if using jupyter 
2. Use the following code to train and evaluate the model:


!pip install numpy
!pip install pandas
!pip install scikit-learn
!pip install matplotlib

Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, scikit-learn 

Sklearn: Metrics

Run cells from top to bottom after installing the libraries

# What parameters to put/change if needed
Hidden size: Change to any value (default is 50 in our code)

train method is as follows: (X values, Y values, epochs)
Epochs: Change to any values (number of runs)   


Evaulate method: Puts out the metrics, like R2 and RMSE




The log file of the experiments is also attached as a separate file.
